# Getting Started with NestJS

## 1. Install Node.js

Before you start with NestJS, you must install **Node.js** on your computer:  
ðŸ‘‰ [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)  

- Choose the **LTS version (Long Term Support)**.  
- Check if Node.js is installed by opening a terminal and running: `node -v`


## 2. Initialize a New NestJS Project

- `nest new notes-api -g`

- `-g` means global installation

- When you run this command, you will be asked to choose a package manager select `npm (y)` to continue

- This will generate a full project structure with all necessary files

## 3. Enter the Project Folder

- `cd notes-api`

- If you cloned the code from the repository, after cd notes-api make sure to run `npm install` or `npm i`. This installs all required libraries (dependencies) used by the project.

## 4. Running the Application

- `npm run start`

- Once it starts, open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:3000`

- You should see: `Hello World!`

## 5. Congratulations ðŸŽ‰

- You have successfully initialized your first NestJS app!
