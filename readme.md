# Web Development Elective - Angular & NestJS ðŸš€

This is the repository for the elective subject "Full Stack Development with Angular & NestJS" as part of the third semester of the Web Development academy at Avenga Academy. During this elective we will create a full stack web application that will be a clone of the popular Twitter web application, implementing its core functionalities using Angular for the front end and NestJS for the back end.

## Why you should learn Angular & NestJS

Angular and NestJS are two powerful frameworks that work perfectly together for building full-stack web applications. Angular is a front-end framework developed by Google, designed for creating scalable, maintainable, and dynamic user interfaces. NestJS is a modern backend framework for Node.js that uses TypeScript and clean architecture principles to build robust and efficient APIs.

Learning Angular & NestJS together gives you the ability to create complete applications from the front-end user experience to the back-end logic and database integration. Both frameworks are used by many big companies worldwide, making them highly valuable skills in the job market. Even if you donâ€™t end up using them in every project, having experience with Angular and NestJS will greatly strengthen your skillset, as they teach you best practices for building structured, scalable, and production-ready applications.
